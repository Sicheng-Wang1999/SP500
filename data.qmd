## Description

1. Interest rate data from 2022-2023
Daily interest rate data is collected by [U.S Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2022) and is downloaded as csv files. The data consists of 1 month rates to 30 year rates and is updated daily, note that since 10/18/2022 there are no 4 months interest rates.
```{r}
APR22 = read.csv("daily-treasury-rates-2022.csv")
APR23 = read.csv("daily-treasury-rates-2023.csv")
APR = bind_rows(APR22,APR23)
head(APR)
```

## Missing value analysis
```{r}
df <- APR22 |> column_to_rownames("Date")
df <- df |> rownames_to_column("id") |> pivot_longer(cols = -id) |> mutate(missing = ifelse(is.na(value),"yes","no"))
ggplot(df, aes(x=name, y=fct_rev(id), fill = missing)) + 
geom_tile()
```
