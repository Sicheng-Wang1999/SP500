    "text": "1.1 Why Explore S&P 500\nThe S&P 500 gives us a snapshot of how well the economy is doing. If just a few companies is not doing well on a single day, it doesn’t drag the index down as there are 500 companies. Thus, S&P 500 often serves as a benchmark for US stock markets, that people often compare with their portfolio with to assess the standing of performance and diversity of individual portfolio relative to the overall market. By exploring the SP500 index on its correlation with economic factors such as interest rates, and through breakdowns by location of headquarter or sector of individual stock. We hope to find hints on how to build the right portfolio at the right time."
